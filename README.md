# MotionPNGTuber

> **Developer Preview --- 2026/04/10 Experimental Build**
> This is a development snapshot. Features and APIs may change without notice.

**Beyond PNGTuber, before Live2D** --- Video-based real-time lip sync system

By using looping video, you can achieve rich expressions like **hair swaying** and **clothing fluttering** that traditional PNGTubers can't deliver. No specialized knowledge like Live2D is required --- just an MP4 video and mouth sprites to get started.

```sh
cd deps
curl -L https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmcv/archive/refs/tags/v1.7.0.tar.gz -o mmcv-1.7.0.tar.gz
tar xzf mmcv-1.7.0.tar.gz && cd mmcv-1.7.0
MMCV_WITH_OPS=1 FORCE_CUDA=0 ../../.venv/bin/python setup.py develop
MMCV_WITH_OPS=1 FORCE_CUDA=0 ../../.venv/bin/python setup.py build_ext --inplace
cd ../..
```

#### 6. Remaining packages

```sh
uv pip install --no-build-isolation anime-face-detector
uv pip install mmdet==2.28.0 mmpose==0.29.0
```

#### 7. Launch

```sh
.venv/bin/python mouth_track_gui.py
```

#### Notes

- Do not delete the `deps/` directory
- Use `+`/`-` keys for calibration zoom (scroll wheel may not work)

</details>

## 🎮 Usage

### Main GUI

```bash
uv run python mouth_track_gui.py
```

> 📝 On macOS, set up dependencies via the [macOS installation steps](#macos-experimental) before launching.

#### Workflow

1. **Create mouth PNG sprites** --- only if the mouth folder doesn't exist yet
2. **Select video** → choose a loop video
3. **Select mouth folder** → choose the folder containing mouth sprites
4. **(1) Analyze → Calibrate** → adjust mouth position and press Space to confirm ([controls](#calibration-controls))
5. **Visual check (lightweight)** → preview margin factor / mouth-erase range without full export
6. **(2) Generate mouthless video** → generates video with mouth erased
7. **(3) Live run** → speak into the mic and the mouth moves!
8. **If the mouth color looks off** → press auto color-blending or adjust sliders manually ([details](#mouth-png-color-correction))

#### Default Settings (changed 2026/04/10)

| Setting | Description | Default |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| Shadow blending (mouth erase) | Smoothly blends the boundary where the mouth was erased, making seams less noticeable | ON |
| HUD display | Shows FPS, mouth open/close state, and other info on screen during live run | OFF |

Both can be toggled via checkboxes in the GUI. If a value is already saved in the session, the saved value takes precedence.

---

### 🖌️ Mouth PNG Creation GUI

```bash
uv run python mouth_sprite_extractor_gui.py
```

If you don't have a mouth folder yet, it's recommended to create one here first.
You can also launch it from the "Create mouth PNG sprites (recommended)" button in the main GUI.
During analysis after selecting a video, the **Processing Status** area at the top shows the current step with a progress bar.

---

### 🔍 Visual Check (Lightweight)

A preview for quickly checking the **margin factor** and **mouth-erase range** before exporting the full mouthless video.

- Uses existing `mouth_track.npz` / `mouth_track_calibrated.npz` as-is, so you can skip heavy processing
- If `open.png` is found, you can also see how the mouth PNG overlays
- Press `Enter` to apply the selected settings to the GUI
- ⚠️ If you change the margin factor, you need to re-run **(1) Analyze → Calibrate**

#### Key Controls

| Key | Function |
|-----|----------|
| Top buttons / `1` `2` `3` | Select margin factor candidate |
| `r` / `f` | Increase / decrease mouth-erase range |
| `a` / `d` | Previous / next frame |
| `[` / `]` | Jump 10 frames back / forward |
| `Space` | Play / pause |
| Apply to GUI button / `Enter` | Apply margin factor / mouth-erase range to GUI |
| `Esc` / `q` | Close without applying |

---

### ⚙️ Advanced Settings

**Advanced settings can usually be left closed.**

The main setting is the **mouth placement margin factor**, which affects mouth placement size during **(1) Analyze → Calibrate**.

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Mouth PNG looks too small / edges are clipped | Increase slightly (e.g., `2.3` ~ `2.6`) |
| Mouth is too large / picks up jaw or cheeks | Decrease slightly (e.g., `1.8` ~ `2.0`) |

The default value of **`2.1`** usually works fine.

Recommended workflow:

1. Run **(1) Analyze → Calibrate** with `2.1`
2. **Visual check (lightweight)** --- compare values around `1.9 / 2.1 / 2.3`
3. Apply the best value → re-run **(1) Analyze → Calibrate**
4. Proceed to **(2) Generate mouthless video**

> ⚠️ The margin factor is used during analysis, so changing it requires re-running **(1) Analyze → Calibrate**.

---

### 🎨 Mouth PNG Color Correction

Adjusts color blending between mouth PNGs and the base video.
Moving the sliders during live run **reflects changes in real time (~hundreds of ms)** without restarting the runtime.

#### Adjustable Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Mouth PNG brightness | Overall mouth brightness |
| Mouth PNG saturation | Color vividness |
| Mouth PNG warm/cool | Color temperature |
| Correction intensity | Overall correction strength |
| Edge priority | How strongly correction applies to mouth edges |
| Edge correction width | Range of edge correction effect |
| Preview: color diff highlight | Makes subtle color mismatches easier to spot (preview only; does not modify assets) |

> **How edge priority works**: Correction is not applied uniformly across the entire mouth PNG --- it applies more strongly to the outer edges.
> This helps reduce issues like "only the mouth edges look out of place" or "the skin boundary doesn't blend."

#### Auto Color Blending

Press the **"Auto color blending"** button during live run to automatically compare the background video's mouth area with the mouth PNG's edge colors and suggest correction values.
You can still fine-tune with sliders after auto-correction.

- Transparent areas of the mouth PNG are ignored; only the **colored edge areas** are analyzed
- The auto-correction button is **only available during live run**
- Changes are auto-saved

#### Recommended Workflow

1. Start **(3) Live run**
2. Optionally increase **color diff highlight** to check for color mismatches
3. Press **Auto color blending**
4. Fine-tune with sliders

<details>
<summary><b>🌐 Browser Output</b></summary>

After completing **(2) Generate mouthless video**, the following files are exported to the same folder:

- `mouth_track.json`
- `*_mouthless_h264.mp4` (if `ffmpeg` is found)

Use these when passing mouth track data to a browser implementation.

- `mouth_track.json` is the main track export
- `*_mouthless_h264.mp4` is recommended for browser / player use when `ffmpeg` is available
- If `ffmpeg` is missing, the GUI still exports `mouth_track.json` and logs that H.264 export was skipped

For **MotionPNGTuber_Player** and other browser implementations that use **AudioWorklet**, opening files via `file://` may block mic / worklet loading. In that case, serve the folder locally:

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
# then open http://localhost:8000
```

<summary><b>❓ Troubleshooting</b></summary>

### Mouth position is misaligned

- First try **Recalibrate only**
- If still too small / too large, use **Visual check (lightweight)** to compare margin factor values
- Then adjust the **margin factor in advanced settings** slightly if needed

### Black smudge in mouth erase

- Try turning **Shadow blending** OFF

### `uv sync` fails

```bash
uv cache clean
uv sync
```

### CUDA not recognized

```bash
uv run python -c "import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())"
```

### Analysis stops on RTX 50-series / newer GPUs

- Root cause: the current Torch / CUDA build may not fully match your GPU architecture
- Prevention: the GUI now starts analysis with `--device auto`, which tries CUDA first and then CPU fallback
- If analysis still fails, rerun from CLI with `--device cpu` and check the log for CUDA compatibility messages

### Analysis looks frozen

- Initial analysis can take time, especially on long videos
- If GPU fallback switches to CPU, processing becomes much slower but is still expected
- Check the progress area and log before assuming the app has hung

### `Analysis error` appears immediately after selecting a video in the mouth PNG GUI

- Root cause (fixed on 2026-04-13): the GUI could fail before tracking started if the bundled detector script path was resolved incorrectly
- Prevention: the detector launcher now searches both the package directory and the repository root, and this lookup is covered by a regression test
- If you still see the error after updating, check the log pane for the exact exception and verify that `face_track_anime_detector.py` exists in the project

<summary><b>🎁 Bonus Tools</b></summary>

### Mouth Sprite Extraction CLI

```bash
uv run python mouth_sprite_extractor.py --video loop.mp4 --out mouth/
```

Extract mouth sprites (5 PNGs) directly from the command line without the GUI.
